# PID-Controller-on-Ball-with-Fan
PID controller in the context of balancing a ping-pong ball using a fan (simulator)

I implemented the equation and by trial and error calculated the Kp, Kd and Ki values.

Integral was approximated by a sum

Derivative was apporximated by a difference of current_error and previous_error over delta_t

frame rate (delta_t) = 1/60

*Thank you to my amazing TA 'Travis Manderson' for providing me with the Simulator's code
